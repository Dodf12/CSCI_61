# Homework_1

##### Abhinav Pala

### Stack Section

Download the Homework1 folder and open it your prefferred editor.

Make sure that you have a g++
compiler that compiles to C++ 11

run the following command in your
terminal

```
g++ HW1.cpp -std=c++11
```

Then run the following command

```
./a.out
```

The first prompt you will see will ask you to enter 
a infix expression with whitespace in the middle

For example, isntead  of this:
```
"A*B+C*D"
```
enter this:
```
"A * B + C * D"
```
Every token must be seperated with space

If your infix has multiple digit numbers, DO NOT seperate those characters.

You MUST enter them like this.

```
"22 * 23 + 24"
```
NOT

```
"2 2 * 2 3 + 2 4"
```

This would result in an error
